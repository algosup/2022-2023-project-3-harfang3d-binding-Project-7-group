What are extern type converter

(translate.json ?)
error running code ?
do we have to follow what they do or can we do it on our own

i128 & u128 & biguint(int256): How to deal with them?)-->



Do they want to see specifications = documentation how to use it
Do they want some kind of delivery (crate, pull request …)
Do we need to cover multiple os’s (Mac especially) -> (rust compiler doesn't work so pls don't) = don't really care about mac

(Do they know there's an issue on test 15 of go ? -> Do they know how to fix it ?) = issue their side






3)change homebrew to intel architecture
either way fine for them
