# Introduction
Harfang3D is a 3D engine and scripting platform developed by Golaem. It is designed for use in a variety of 3D applications, including films, games, and visual effects. This document outlines the requirements for a binding of Harfang3D in Rust, which will allow Rust programs to use the functionality provided by the Harfang3D C++ API.

# Objectives
The main objectives of the binding are to:
* Provide Rust programs with access to all of the functions and data structures in the Harfang3D C++ API.
* Be easy to use and integrate into Rust programs, with a clear and simple API that is easy to learn and use.
* Be well-tested, with comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure that it works correctly and is reliable.
* Be actively maintained, with regular updates to fix bugs and add new features.
* Be released under an open source license, allowing developers to use and modify it as needed.

# Scope
The scope of the binding includes:
* All functions and data structures in the Harfang3D C++ API.
* Support for all platforms that Harfang3D supports, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
* Documentation for all functions and data structures, including descriptions of their behavior and usage examples.
* Memory management and other low-level details.

# Requirements
The binding must meet the following requirements:
* Provide Rust programs with access to all of the functions and data structures in the Harfang3D C++ API.
* Be implemented as a Rust crate
* Support all platforms that Harfang3D supports, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
* Provide documentation for all functions and data structures, including descriptions of their behavior and usage examples.
* Be easy to use and integrate into Rust programs, with a clear and simple API that is easy to learn and use.
* Be well-tested, with comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure that it works correctly and is reliable.
* Be actively maintained, with regular updates to fix bugs and add new features.
* Be released under an open source license, allowing developers to use and modify it as needed.

# Deliverables
The final deliverables for the binding will include:
* The Rust crate, including all necessary Rust code and configuration files.
* Documentation for the crate, including descriptions of all functions and data structures, usage examples, and any other necessary information.
* Tests for the crate, including unit and integration tests to ensure that it works correctly and is reliable.

# Maintenance
The binding will be actively maintained, with regular updates to fix bugs and add new features. The maintenance plan will include:
* Responding to bug reports and issues filed on the project's issue tracker.
* Releasing new versions of the crate with bug fixes and new features.
* Providing support and assistance to users of the crate.

# License
The binding will be released under an open source license, allowing developers to use and modify it as needed. 


# Compatibility
The binding should be compatible with the latest stable version of Rust, as well as any earlier versions that are still in active use.

# Documentation
The binding should include comprehensive documentation for all functions and data structures, including descriptions of their behavior and usage examples. The documentation should be easy to understand and follow, and should include both high-level overviews and detailed explanations of specific features.

# Testing
The binding should be well-tested, with comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure that it works correctly and is reliable. The testing plan should include both manual and automated testing, and should be designed to cover a wide range of use cases and edge cases.

# Deployment
The binding should be distributed as a fork of the existing repository of the Harfang3D C++ API. The fork should include all necessary Rust code and configuration files, and should be kept up to date with the latest version of the C++ API.

# Support
The binding should be actively maintained, with regular updates to fix bugs and add new features. Users will also be able to file bug reports and feature requests on the project's issue tracker on Github, and will be able to receive support and assistance from the developers.

# Conclusion
This functional specification outlines the requirements for a binding of Harfang3D in Rust, which will provide Rust programs with access to the functionality provided by the Harfang3D C++ API. By meeting these requirements, the binding will allow Rust developers to use Harfang3D in their projects, and will provide a safe and idiomatic interface for working with the API.
