# Goals

Our main goal is to create bindings[^1] between C++[^2] and Rust[^3] programming languages.
This project is realised for the use of Harfang[^4] and is an extention to the FabGEN[^5] Python library.

For this project our research will strongly focus on:

​* The client (and their specific needs)
* Understanding how bindings work
* Understanding how FabGEN works
* The specifics of C++ and Rust
* (Optional) Learning how to use Harfang3D

## Client
​
Our client is [Harfang](https://www.harfang3d.com/en_US/). They created an efficient and memory safe 3D engine. Harfang3d has been mainly created for industrial use and simulations rather then video games.

## Product

The endproduct is an extention to the [FabGEN](https://github.com/ejulien/FABGen) Python library. The purpose of this library is to create bindings between C++ and a variety of other programming languages.
At the moment, FabGEN is used to bind towards CPython, Lua and GoLang.
Our objective is to add Rust to that list.

# documentation saving and sharing system
​
Most of the research done during this project focuses around the minute details necessary for the implementation of the project. Such details are rarely useful beyond their immediate use and as such are not saved anywhere.

If the document in question is deemed important enough to be shared with the entierity of the group or must be saved for longterm use then it is shared in the Discord server created for the sake of communication between team members.

# Resources

As a starting point, we have access to the following documents:

- [FabGEN's Github Repository](https://github.com/ejulien/FABGen)
- [The Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html)
- [A Github repository created for the collaboration between Harfang and ALGOSUP](https://github.com/harfang3d/algosup-binding-project)
- [Harfang3D's Github repository](https://github.com/harfang3d/harfang3d)
- [Harfang3D's documentation](https://dev.harfang3d.com/)
