# Research notes
The client research is quite similar to the product research since Fabgen and Harfang are linked. In addition we don't have a lot of research to do on Fabgen since all the information we need is in the code we need to understand.
For those reasons both product and client research will be together.

## Who is the client
<!-- > write down here your research on who is the client, his priorities, his specificities, etc -->
Our final client is [Harfang3D](https://www.harfang3d.com/en_US/). Their final product is the 3D engine that is used for many different purposes, from simulations of scenarios and statistics to car overhead displays. Their need is to bring harfang to as many people as possible and to make it as easy to use as possible.
The product we will deliver is an extension of Fabgen for Rust users. It will allow Harfang to reach a wider userbase.

## His/her field
The field of Harfang is 3D engines. It is a very competitive field, with many different engines, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The main competitors are Unity and Unreal Engine.

The field of Fabgen is software development. It is the field we are working on and we do not directly impact Harfang's field. We do not have a direct impact on Harfang since we work on Fabgen. However, we do have an indirect impact on Harfang since Fabgen was created to bring Harfang to different languages.

## Target audience/customer
Harfang's target audience is developpers and designers. It allows designer to create 3D scenes easily thanks to its studio and developpers to run the same simulations directly with code. It is used in many different fields because it is very versatile and accessible mostly because of its variety of languages.


## Competition
Harfang is a 3D engine. It is a very competitive field, with many different engines, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The main competitors are Unity and Unreal Engine.

Fabgen has a few "competitors" in the sense that they are other software that ressembles Fabgen. However, they are not as complete as Fabgen. The main ones are [SWIG](https://www.swig.org/) and [bindgen](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/).
